# Day 01 | Control structures
A set of practice problems solved with Python
## Exercise 1 
1. Write a __program__ which displays the integers between two integers __a__ and __b__ (enteredby the user) as well as their sum and their average. Not necessarily a <b (With the __for loop__).
2. Write a __program__ that displays all odd integers between two integers __a__ and __b__ (entered by the user) as well as their sum and their average. (With __while__)
3. Write a __program__ that displays the inverses of all integers between two integers __a__ and __b__ (entered by the user) as well as their sum and their average.

## Exercise 2
* Write a program that tests whether an integer n (entered by the user) is perfect or not.

_(A number n is perfect if it is equal to the sum of all its divisors <n, for example 6 is perfect because it is the sum of 1, 2 and 3 which are its divisors <6, while 12 is not)._

## Exercise 3
Write a program that calculates the factorial of an integer n entered by the user.

## Exercise 5
Write a program that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers entered by the user (use the while loop).

## Exercise 6
Write a program that asks the user to type an integer. This one has 5 tries.
* If the typed character is a 0 we display "won" and stop.
* If after 5 attempts, the user has not always typed 0, we exit by displaying "lost".

## Exercise 7
* Write a program for estimating the value of Ï€ (3.14159265358979 ...) according to the following two formulas:

## Exercise 8
Write a program that displays the multiplication table from 1 to 9.

## Exercise 9
Write a program that displays:

```
* * * *
